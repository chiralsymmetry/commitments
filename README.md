# Commitments
Commitments is a simple application to aid you in writing clear and
consise Git commit messages, reminding you of — but not enforcing — what
is commonly seen as “best practices”. It supports the use of “types”
and “footers” in the vein of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

## Usage
Download, run, click, write, copy, and paste into your favorite Git
commit message editor.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
- <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>: Jump to “Types” text box.
- <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd>: Jump to “Header” text box.
- <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>: Jump to “Body” text box.
- <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>: Jump to “Footer” text box.
- <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>: Copy full commit message.
- <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>: Show Preview window.
- <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>: Add “Breaking Change” footer.
- <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Delete</kbd>: Clear all.

Likewise, the Preview window has keyboard shortcuts:
- <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> **or** <kbd>Escape</kbd>: Close Preview
  window.
- <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>: Copy full commit message.
- <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Delete</kbd>: Close & clear all.

## Settings
Settings may be provided through a text file named `appsettings.json`,
where one may define types and footers with helpful reminders. A few
common ones are supplied by default.

## Contributing
The application may be trivial, but contributions are welcome.
